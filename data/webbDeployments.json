The duration of the burn will depend on Ariane 5 launcher performance.</p> <p>The James Webb Space Telescope is launched on a direct path to an orbit around the second Sun-Earth Lagrange Point (L2), but it needs to make its own mid-course thrust correction maneuvers to get there. This is by design, because if Webb gets too much thrust from the Ariane rocket, it can’t turn around to thrust back toward Earth because that would directly expose its telescope optics and structure to the Sun, overheating them and aborting the science mission before it can even begin. Therefore, Webb gets an intentional slight under-burn from the Ariane and uses its own small thrusters and on-board propellant to make up the difference.</p> <p>There will be three mid-course correction (MCC) maneuvers: MCC-1a, MCC-1b, and MCC-2. The first burn, MCC-1a, is the most important and the only other time-critical operation aside from solar array deployment during Webb’s commissioning period. </p>",

The primary mirror segments also have an additional actuator at its center that adjusts its curvature. The telescope's tertiary mirror remains stationary. The primary and secondary mirror segments will move a total of 12.5mm, in small increments, over the course of ~10 days to complete each segment's deployment. </p> <p>After all individual mirror segment deployments are completed, the detailed optical mirror alignment process begins which is about a 3 month process. In parallel, as temperatures cool enough, instrument teams will turn on their instruments and begin each instrument's commissioning process.</p> <p> Video: <a href='https://youtu.be/hET2MS1tIjA?t=2226' target='_webbYouTube'> Next Steps Explained at Press Conference </a></p> <p> Video: <a href='https://youtu.be/_2zQiWeXTg4' target='_webbYouTube'> Mirror Alignment  </a></p>  <p> Read:<a target='_readMore' href='/content/observatory/ote/mirrors/index.html#1c'>About Webb's adjustable mirrors.</a> </p> <p> Read:<a target='_readMore' href='/content/observatory/ote/mirrors/index.html#8'>How 18 mirrors see as one.</a> </p> <p> Read:<a target='_readMore' href='/content/about/innovations/wavefront.html'>Mirror Alignment Technology Spinoffs.</a> </p>",

The vast majority of the energy required to place Webb in L2 orbit was provided by the Ariane 5 rocket.

MCC2 is the final burn to fine tune Webb's halo orbit. </p><p>The adjacent diagram shows a conceptual view of <a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasawebbtelescope/51886649707/in/album-72177720296738159/' target='_webbFlickr'>Webb's trajectory </a> and halo orbit. Webb launched on the sun-facing side of the earth and travelled a slightly curved trajectory for the ~1,000,000mi (~1,609,344km) to enter its L2 halo orbit. A halo orbit is one which rather than follow a single path, is an orbit that periodically varies through a series of paths.

The team has selected the star HD 84406 as its target to begin this process. It will be the first object NIRCam “sees” when photons of light hit the instrument’s powered-on detectors. The process will essentially create an image of 18 random, blurry points of light. For the first few weeks of mirror alignment, the team will keep the instrument trained on the star while they make microscopic adjustments to the mirror segments; ultimately that collection of 18 blurry dots will become a focused image of a single star. Cooling of the telescope and instruments will also continue over the next month, with the near-infrared instruments ultimately reaching 34-39 kelvins.</p><p> <p>Coverage Replay: <a target='_webbYoutube' href='https://youtu.be/VmD8pefGG2k?t=949'>Media Telecon - What's Next?</a>  </p></p>",

MIRI carries detectors that need to be at a temperature of less than 7 kelvins to be able to detect longer wavelength photons. This temperature is not possible on Webb by passive means alone, so Webb carries an  <a href='/content/about/innovations/cryocooler.html'>innovative cryocooler that is dedicated to cooling MIRI's detectors</a>.</p> <p> This cryocooler uses helium gas to carry heat from MIRI’s optics and detectors out to the warm side of the sunshield. To manage the cooldown process, MIRI also has heaters on-board, to protect its sensitive components from the risk of ice forming. The Webb team has begun progressively adjusting both the cryocooler and these heaters, to ensure a slow, controlled, stable cooldown for the instrument. Soon, the team will turn off MIRI’s heaters entirely, to bring the instrument down to its operating temperature of less than 7 kelvins (-447 degrees Fahrenheit, or -266 degrees Celsius). </p> <p> TRACK:<a href='/content/webbLaunch/whereIsWebb.html'>MIRI's Temperature</a></p><p>READ: <a target='_webbBlog' href='https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/04/21/is-webb-at-its-final-temperature/' title='is-webb-at-its-final-temperature' > MIRI Status: &nbsp; 5 </a> | <a target='_webbBlog' href='https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/webb-telescope-s-coldest-instrument-reaches-operating-temperature' title='webb-telescope-s-coldest-instrument-reaches-operating-temperature'> 4 </a>  | <a target='_webbBlog' href='https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/04/06/webbs-mid-infrared-instrument-cooldown-continues/' title='webbs-mid-infrared-instrument-cooldown-continues'> 3</a>  | <a target='_webbBlog' href='https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/04/01/webb-completes-first-multi-instrument-alignment' title='webb-completes-first-multi-instrument-alignment'> 2</a> | <a target='_webbBlog' href='https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/03/24/webb-continues-multi-instrument-alignment/' title='webb-continues-multi-instrument-alignment'>1</a> ",

We will measure the sharpness of stellar images at each point in an instrument’s image to enable the optimal extraction of scientific information.
